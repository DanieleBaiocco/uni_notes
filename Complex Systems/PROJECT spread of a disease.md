1. Mostra comportamenti CAOTICI, quindi cambiando di pochissimo i parametri iniziali (piccole perturbazioni) mostra che il risultato finale e' molto diverso\


* A simple path is a path where the nodes do not repeat.
* A cycle is a path where the first and last nodes are the same, but otherwise all nodes are distinct
* The length of a path in a graph is the number of steps it contains from beginning to end — the number of edges
* The distance between two nodes in a graph is the length of the shortest path between them
* Diameter of a graph is the longest of the distances between all pairs of nodes — the longest shortest path
* A subgraph is connected if there is a path between every pair of nodes
* A component of a graph is a maximal connected subgraph
* A graph is connected if it contains a single component
* If the largest component of a graph contains a significant proportion of all nodes, it is called the giant component
* An edge in a graph is a bridge if deleting it increases the number of components of the graph
* Clustering Coefficient is The fraction of all pairs of A’s friends who are also friends
* The clustering coefficient CC of graph G is the average of the clustering coefficients of all nodes in G
* A graph is highly clustered only if the actual likelihood of a triangle being closed is substantially greater than what we would expect due to pure chance (calcolando l'edge density ho questa seconda cosa)
* Edge density of a graph is the actual number of edges in proportion to the maximum possible number of edges
* m/(n(n-1)/2) numero di edges diviso numero  totale di POSSIBILI edges
* The probability that two nodes are connected, taken at random, is the edge density
* Highly clustered se CC>>p
