# Il sistema nervoso
3 tipi di sinapsi:
- Axosomatic: sinapsi che si legano al soma dell'altro neurone
- Axodendritic: si legano ai dendtriti dell'altro neurone
- Axoaxonic: si legano all'axon dell'altro neurone. Servono per presynaptic inibhition o presynaptic facilitation.
3 tipi di neuroni:
- sensory neurons: carry information from the body’s peripheral sensors into the nervous system for the purpose of both perception and motor coordination
- motor neurons: carry commands from the brain or spinal cord to muscles and glands
- interneurons: mediate impulses between sensory and motor neurons
Il signals nei neuroni e' organizzato sempre nel seguente modo:
- Input signal (receptive): where neurons collert and integrate info, either from the env or from other cells
- trigger signal (summing or integrative): where the decision to produce a neural signal is made
- conducting signal (signaling): where info can be transmitted over great distances
- output signal: where the neuron transfers info to other cells
Parliamo della trasmissione del segnale all'interno di un neurone:
inizia tutto con il **resting potential** ovvero e' un potentia pari a -70 mV in quanto the voltage of the inside of the cell is about 70 mV more negative than the voltage outside the cell. This electrical potential difference means that the neuron has at its disposal a kind of battery.
This arises from the asymmetric distribution of ions across the neuron's cell membrane.
This is due to Na+/K+ pump that use energy to actively transport ions through the membrane and this transport  more NA+ outside than K+ inside.
This creates a **concentration gradient**: Na+ wants to enter the cell, K+ wants to exit the cell.
There are also **ion channels** that allow  ions to flow passively down their concentration gradient. The membrane permeability to K+ is larger because there are **many more K+ selective channels than any other type of ion channel** .
This creates **electrical gradient**, as K+ exit the cell, they leave behind a cloud of negative charge on the inner surface of the membrane.
Eventually, the force of the concentration gradient pushing K+ out is equal to the force of the electrical gradient driving K+ in
When that happens, the opposing forces are said to reach electrochemical equilibrium
The difference in charge thus produced across the membrane is the resting membrane potential, that −70 mV difference

he alteration in the resting membrane potential can be either
• a decrease: depolarization : this enhance the ability to generate action potential (e' quando ho che la differenza di potenziale diminuisce fino a diventare quasi positiva lol ), It generates an excitatory postsynaptic potential 
• an increase: hyperpolarization . It reduces the ability to generate action potential. So it generates an Inhibitory postsynaptic potential (e' quando diventa tanto negativo molto piuu di 70)

An individual neuron **sums excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic potentials received at spatially separate synapses** (SPATIAL SUMMATION). When **the sum of the potentials present at one time depolarizes the axon hillock to threshold** (of -55 mV ), the neuron generates an **action potential**
La spatial summation  occorre quando diversi excitatory postsynaptic potentials  (EPSPs)arrivano all'axion hillock. 
NOTA: The maximum distance a passive current (e.g. EPSP) will flow is only about 1 millimeter. The longest axon of a human motor neuron can be over a meter long

But the action potential is actively propagated along the axon and its amplitude does not diminish by the time it reaches the axon terminal.

**action potential**
Neurons evolved a clever mechanism to regenerate and pass along the signal
This regenerative process is an active membrane mechanism known as the action potential
An action potential is a rapid depolarization and repolarization of a small region of the membrane caused by the opening and closing of ion channels

This is what happens:
- The neuron gets excited and it exeeed the threshold for all we have said
- Depolarization causes voltage-gated Na+ channels to open, quindi l'Na+ va dentro il neurone perche ce n'e' piu fuori che dentro (gradient potential)
- Queste cariche positive neutralizzano quelle negative interne 
- Il neurone viene depolarizzato, questo provoca in cascata l'apertura di altri Na+ gated channels che aumentano la depolarizzazione
- A una certa si raggiunge un equilibrium potential per l'Na+ (il gradiente ora e' pari)
- Questa depolarizzazione apre i Voltage-gated K+ channels, permettendo cosi ai K+ di uscire dal neurone  seguendo il concentration gradient (ce ne stanno di piu di fuori che dentro)
- Cio fino a che ho un equilibrium potential per K+ che pero' lasciia dentro il neurone una carica negativa che e' anche piu negativa di quella del resting potential (ho hyperpolarization che permette di far fluire SOLO in una direzione il segnale): During hyperpolarization the voltage-gated Na+ channels cannot open. This Limits the number of action potentials that a neuron can generate in a given time and   ensures  Unidirectional current flow
- A una certa i K+ chanels si chiudono e The membrane potential can return to its resting state

Important facts about action potentials (its properties):
- Thresholdfor initiation: only "meaningful" information leads to an AP
- All-or-none nature: APs are binary signals, they all have the same amplitude and duration, regardless of the size of the PSP that generated it. The size and shape of an action potential initiated by a large depolarizing current is the same as that of an action potential evoked by a current that just surpasses the threshold. This means the strength of the action potential does not communicate anything about the strength of the stimulus (so the truth is that **More intense stimuli elicit higher action potential firing rates** quindi ho piu action potentials di uguale intensita' ma di piu molti di piu)
- Conducted without decrement: It has a self-regenerative feature that keeps the amplitude constant, even when it is conducted over great distances
- Refractory period: limits the frequency at which a nerve can fire action potentials, and the signal travels only in one direction

Note that at chemical synapses, the frequency of action potentials determines exactly how much neurotransmitter is released by the cell

**Principle of connectional specificity**
Nerve cells do not connect randomly with one another in the formation of networks. Rather each cell makes specific connections—at particular contact points— with certain postsynaptic target cells but not with others
